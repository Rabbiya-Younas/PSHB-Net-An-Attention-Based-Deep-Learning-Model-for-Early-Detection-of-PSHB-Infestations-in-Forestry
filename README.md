# PSHB-Net-An-Attention-Based-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Early-Detection-of-PSHB-Infestations-in-Forestry
Implementation of PSHB-Net: a deep learning framework for early detection of Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer infestations in forestry. Part of an ongoing research project. (Dataset not included due to licensing.

This repository contains the implementation of **PSHB-Net**, a deep learning model designed for the early detection of **Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer (PSHB)** infestations in forestry environments.

## ðŸŒ¿ About the Project

Forests are facing increasing threats from invasive species like PSHB, which are hard to detect in early stages. This model aims to assist with **early identification of PSHB symptoms from tree images**, making it possible to act before widespread damage occurs.

##Main Contributions ##
1) Dataset generated with 16000 images
2) Preprocessing of the dataset for features extractions
3) Model designed to give accuratee results
4) Results provide 99% precision

Our model architecture integrates:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Frequency domain analysis via Fourier Transform
- Attention mechanisms to prioritize visual features

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset

A dedicated dataset was prepared by collecting images of PSHB-infected and healthy trees from various public sources.

> **Note:** The dataset is not included here due to licensing and publication restrictions. Please contact the authors for further information.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
